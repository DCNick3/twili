# Twili

Twili is a debug monitor/bridge for homebrew applications running on the Nintendo Switch.

The debug monitor aspect of it aims to provide a sane solution for stdio and logging, and to ease development by generating crash reports.
The debug bridge aspect aims to provide similar utilities to [ADB](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb), allowing fast and convenient sideloading and filesystem access.
